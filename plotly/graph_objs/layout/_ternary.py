        The 'aaxis' property is an instance of Aaxis
        that may be specified as:
          - An instance of plotly.graph_objs.layout.ternary.Aaxis
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the Aaxis constructor
    
            Supported dict properties:
                
                color
                    Sets default for all colors associated with
                    this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and
                    grid colors. Grid color is lightened by
                    blending this with the plot background
                    Individual pieces can override this.
                dtick
                    Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis.
                    Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or
                    special strings available to "log" and "date"
                    axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks
                    are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick
                    number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1,
                    10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick
                    marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To
                    set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...
                    set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log"
                    has several special values; "L<f>", where `f`
                    is a positive number, gives ticks linearly
                    spaced in value (but not position). For example
                    `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
                    at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10
                    plus small digits between, use "D1" (all
                    digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is
                    ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type`
                    is "date", then you must convert the time to
                    milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
                    between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to
                    86400000.0. "date" also has special values
                    "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of
                    months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set
                    ticks on the 15th of every third month, set
                    `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To
                    set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
                exponentformat
                    Determines a formatting rule for the tick
                    exponents. For example, consider the number
                    1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as
                    1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If
                    "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If
                    "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
                gridcolor
                    Sets the color of the grid lines.
                gridwidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.
                hoverformat
                    Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h

                    format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format We
                    add one item to d3's date formatter: "%{n}f"
                    for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                    example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                    tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                    "09~15~23.46"
                layer
                    Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed.
                    If *above traces*, this axis is displayed above
                    all the subplot's traces If *below traces*,
                    this axis is displayed below all the subplot's
                    traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when
                    used together with scatter-like traces with
                    `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers
                    and/or text nodes above this axis.
                linecolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                linewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                min
                    The minimum value visible on this axis. The
                    maximum is determined by the sum minus the
                    minimum values of the other two axes. The full
                    view corresponds to all the minima set to zero.
                nticks
                    Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                    particular axis. The actual number of ticks
                    will be chosen automatically to be less than or
                    equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if
                    `tickmode` is set to "auto".
                separatethousands
                    If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
                showexponent
                    If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                    significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                    the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                    exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                    no exponents appear.
                showgrid
                    Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn.
                    If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick
                    mark.
                showline
                    Determines whether or not a line bounding this
                    axis is drawn.
                showticklabels
                    Determines whether or not the tick labels are
                    drawn.
                showtickprefix
                    If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                    prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                    displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                    last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                    "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
                showticksuffix
                    Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
                tick0
                    Sets the placement of the first tick on this
                    axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is
                    "log", then you must take the log of your
                    starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to
                    100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when
                    `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If
                    the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date
                    string, like date data. If the axis `type` is
                    "category", it should be a number, using the
                    scale where each category is assigned a serial
                    number from zero in the order it appears.
                tickangle
                    Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                    to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                    of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
                tickcolor
                    Sets the tick color.
                tickfont
                    Sets the tick font.
                tickformat
                    Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h

                    Sets the tick length (in px).
                tickmode
                    Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",
                    the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If
                    "linear", the placement of the ticks is
                    determined by a starting position `tick0` and a
                    tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default
                    value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If
                    "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
                    `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.
                    ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is
                    provided).
                tickprefix
                    Sets a tick label prefix.
                ticks
                    Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If
                    **, this axis' ticks are not drawn. If
                    "outside" ("inside"), this axis' are drawn
                    outside (inside) the axis lines.
                ticksuffix
                    Sets a tick label suffix.
                ticktext
                    Sets the text displayed at the ticks position
                    via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if
                    `tickmode` is set to "array". Used with
                    `tickvals`.
                ticktextsrc
                    Sets the source reference on plot.ly for
                    ticktext .
                tickvals
                    Sets the values at which ticks on this axis
                    appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set
                    to "array". Used with `ticktext`.
                tickvalssrc
                    Sets the source reference on plot.ly for
                    tickvals .
                tickwidth
                    Sets the tick width (in px).
                title
                    Sets the title of this axis.

                    "09~15~23.46"
                layer
                    Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed.
                    If *above traces*, this axis is displayed above
                    all the subplot's traces If *below traces*,
                    this axis is displayed below all the subplot's
                    traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when
                    used together with scatter-like traces with
                    `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers
                    and/or text nodes above this axis.
                linecolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                linewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                min
                    The minimum value visible on this axis. The
                    maximum is determined by the sum minus the
                    minimum values of the other two axes. The full
                    view corresponds to all the minima set to zero.
                nticks
                    Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                    particular axis. The actual number of ticks
                    will be chosen automatically to be less than or
                    equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if
                    `tickmode` is set to "auto".
                separatethousands
                    If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
                showexponent
                    If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                    significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                    the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                    exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                    no exponents appear.
                showgrid
                    Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn.
                    If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick
                    mark.
                showline
                    Determines whether or not a line bounding this
                    axis is drawn.
                showticklabels
                    Determines whether or not the tick labels are
                    drawn.
                showtickprefix
                    If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                    prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                    displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                    last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                    "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
                showticksuffix
                    Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
                tick0
                    Sets the placement of the first tick on this
                    axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is
                    "log", then you must take the log of your
                    starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to
                    100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when
                    `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If
                    the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date
                    string, like date data. If the axis `type` is
                    "category", it should be a number, using the
                    scale where each category is assigned a serial
                    number from zero in the order it appears.
                tickangle
                    Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                    to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                    of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
                tickcolor
                    Sets the tick color.
                tickfont
                    Sets the tick font.
                tickformat
                    Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h

                    add one item to d3's date formatter: "%{n}f"
                    for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                    example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                    tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display

                tickmode
                    Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",
                    the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If
                    "linear", the placement of the ticks is
                    determined by a starting position `tick0` and a
                    tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default
                    value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If
                    "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
                    `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.
                    ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is
                    provided).
                tickprefix
                    Sets a tick label prefix.
                ticks
                    Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If
                    **, this axis' ticks are not drawn. If
                    "outside" ("inside"), this axis' are drawn
                    outside (inside) the axis lines.
                ticksuffix
                    Sets a tick label suffix.
                ticktext
                    Sets the text displayed at the ticks position
                    via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if
                    `tickmode` is set to "array". Used with
                    `tickvals`.
                ticktextsrc

                    blending this with the plot background
                    Individual pieces can override this.
                dtick
                    Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis.
                    Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or
                    special strings available to "log" and "date"
                    axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks
                    are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick
                    number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1,
                    10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick
                    marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To
                    set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...
                    set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log"
                    has several special values; "L<f>", where `f`
                    is a positive number, gives ticks linearly
                    spaced in value (but not position). For example
                    `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
                    at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10
                    plus small digits between, use "D1" (all
                    digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is
                    ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type`
                    is "date", then you must convert the time to
                    milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
                    between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to
                    86400000.0. "date" also has special values
                    "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of
                    months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set
                    ticks on the 15th of every third month, set
                    `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To
                    set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
                exponentformat
                    Determines a formatting rule for the tick
                    exponents. For example, consider the number
                    1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as
                    1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If
                    "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If
                    "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
                gridcolor
                    Sets the color of the grid lines.

                    this axis is displayed below all the subplot's
                    traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when
                    used together with scatter-like traces with
                    `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers

                min
                    The minimum value visible on this axis. The

                    Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                    particular axis. The actual number of ticks

                    If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
                showexponent
                    If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                    significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                    the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                    exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                    no exponents appear.
                showgrid
                    Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn.
                    If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick
                    mark.
                showline
                    Determines whether or not a line bounding this
                    axis is drawn.
                showticklabels
                    Determines whether or not the tick labels are
                    drawn.
                showtickprefix
                    If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                    prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                    displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                    last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                    "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
                showticksuffix
                    Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
                tick0
                    Sets the placement of the first tick on this
                    axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is
                    "log", then you must take the log of your
                    starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to
                    100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when
                    `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If
                    the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date
                    string, like date data. If the axis `type` is
                    "category", it should be a number, using the
                    scale where each category is assigned a serial
                    number from zero in the order it appears.
                tickangle
                    Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                    to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                    of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
                tickcolor
                    Sets the tick color.
                tickfont
                    Sets the tick font.
                tickformat
                    Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h
                    ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/READ
                    ME.md#locale_format And for dates see:

                    format/blob/master/README.md#locale_format We
                    add one item to d3's date formatter: "%{n}f"
                    for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                    example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                    tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display
                    "09~15~23.46"

                ticklen
                    Sets the tick length (in px).
                tickmode
                    Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",
                    the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If
                    "linear", the placement of the ticks is
                    determined by a starting position `tick0` and a
                    tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default
                    value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If
                    "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
                    `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.
                    ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is
                    provided).
                tickprefix
                    Sets a tick label prefix.
                ticks
                    Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If
                    **, this axis' ticks are not drawn. If
                    "outside" ("inside"), this axis' are drawn
                    outside (inside) the axis lines.
                ticksuffix
                    Sets a tick label suffix.
                ticktext
                    Sets the text displayed at the ticks position
                    via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if
                    `tickmode` is set to "array". Used with
                    `tickvals`.
                ticktextsrc
                    Sets the source reference on plot.ly for
                    ticktext .
                tickvals
                    Sets the values at which ticks on this axis
                    appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set
                    to "array". Used with `ticktext`.
                tickvalssrc
                    Sets the source reference on plot.ly for
                    tickvals .
                tickwidth
                    Sets the tick width (in px).
                title
                    Sets the title of this axis.
                titlefont
                    Sets this axis' title font.
